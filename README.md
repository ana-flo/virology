# virology

Nextsrain based workflow for viral sequence analysis. This repository contains snakefiles for running augur and auspice.

It also contains R markdown scripts that are used for : 
1. Parsing genebank files to get a metadata compatible to nextstrain required input
2. Parse nextstrain output to add some extra visualisations and compute frequencies of mutations across the entire sampled population or subgroups.
